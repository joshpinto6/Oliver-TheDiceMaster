## Oliver, the Dice Master
üé≤ Source code for Oliver The DiceMaster (Post-Jam) Godot Port.

You can play the Jam Version of the game [here.](https://joshpinto6.itch.io/oliver-the-dice-master)

**Copied from the itch.io page:**

"OLIVER THE DICEMASTER" is a  Kirby-inspired platformer centering around dice-throwing combat. Play as Oliver, battling through levels, collecting dice, and using them to defeat numbered enemies. 

> The game was an entry to [GMTK Game Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022) for the theme "ROLL OF THE DICE". I think it turned out really well for my first 48-hour jam. 
If the web embed above doesn't work, you can download an HTML file from the bottom of this page.

**Rules:**

- Find dice in chests and use your dice points (shown above hearts) to roll a dice. Each roll costs 1 dice point.
- If you roll a 6, you gain 1 dice point. But if you run out of dice points while enemies still remain, you lose.
- Attack enemies with rolled dice by equipping dice and pressing X.
- Each enemy has a number over its head representing the minimum total number of the dice combination needed to defeat it.
- Defeat all enemies on a level to unlock the portal!

**Controls:**

‚Üê  ‚Üí  (A D) -  move,  ‚Üë  (W) - jump 

Z - Select, Interact, Open Inventory

X - Go Back, Attack (When equipped)

R - to restart the level (shouldn't be necessary)

You can also play the game using almost any USB or Bluetooth gamepad (click the gamepad icon in the bottom-right of the controls screen to see instructions.)
